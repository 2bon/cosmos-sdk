# Deploy Testnets

Here you'll find details about setting up local or remote testnets in various ways. Much of the content is similar to the [networks documentation in Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/master/docs/networks) but adapted for use with the Cosmos SDK.

The first place to explore is the [networks directory](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/networks) which contains a plethora of information, scripts, and required files for running various types of testnets on various platforms.

## Locally


## Remotely

## Terraform & Ansible
